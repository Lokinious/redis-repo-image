# Redis Docker Image

Welcome to the Redis Docker image repository. This image provides a simple and configurable setup for running a Redis server in a Docker container.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Redis Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/redis-docker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd redis-docker
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-redis-image .
   ```

### Running a Redis Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a Redis container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-redis-container -p 6379:6379 my-redis-image
```

This command starts a Redis container in detached mode, with the name "my-redis-container," and maps host port 6379 to the container port 6379.

### Accessing Redis

You can now access the Redis server using a Redis client or command-line tools. For example, using the `redis-cli` command:

```bash
redis-cli
```

### Customization

- **Password Protection:** You can set a password for the Redis server by uncommenting and modifying the `ENV REDIS_PASSWORD` line in the Dockerfile.
